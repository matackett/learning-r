## Data types in R

There are a number of data types in R. The most common ones that you will run 
into as you begin your journey in R are

- `logical`: boolean values `TRUE` or `FALSE` (often abbreviated as `T` or `F`)
- `double`: floating point numerical values (the default numerical type)
- `integer`: integer numerical values (take up less "space" than doubles). To 
force R to use an integer instead of a double, write `L` after the number.
- `character`: character strings

We can use the `typeof` function to find the data type of an object in R. Try 
using the `typeof` function in the space provided:

```{r typeof, exercise = TRUE}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(F)
typeof("hello")
typeof("F")
typeof(1.2385)
typeof(8)
typeof(7L)
typeof(1:3)
```

when reading data into R and glimpsing it using the `glimpse` command from the
`tidyverse`, you'll often see what data type each variable is (for instance,
`<chr>` or `<dbl>`, etc.).

## Vectors

A collection of elements that are all the same data type is called a **vector**.
Vectors can be constructed using the `c()` function, which stands for 
concatenation. Note that all elements of a vector must be the same data type. 
**Implicit coercion** will happen if you mix types. Try running the following 
code. What do you notice?

```{r vectors, exercise = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
typeof(x)

y <- c("Hello", "World!")
y
typeof(y)

z <- c(1, "Hello")
z
typeof(z)

w <- c(1, -4:-8, TRUE, FALSE)
w
typeof(w)
```

In general, R will convert all values of a vector to the simplest type needed to
represent all the information.

## Missing and special values

R uses `NA` to represent missing values in its data structures:

```{r na, exercise = TRUE}
typeof(NA)

x <- c(4, NA, pi, log(2))
x
typeof(x)

y <- c(NA, NA, NA)
y
typeof(y)
```

R also has the following special values which are often used in mathematical
evaluation:

- `NaN`: not a number
- `Inf`: positive infinity
- `-Inf`: negative infinity

Play around with some of these values in the following area:

```{r nan-inf, exercise = TRUE}
-pi / 0

0 / 0

1 / 0 - 1 / 0

NaN / NA
```

What is the type of the following vectors? Explain why they have that type.

- `c(1, NA + 1L, "C")`
- `c(1L / 0, NA)`
- `c(1:3, 5)`
- `c(3L, NaN + 1L)`
- `c(NA, TRUE)`

Check your answers in the space above. Were you correct?

## Data "sets"

A data set is not a formal data class in R. A tidy data "set" can be one either
a `tibble` or a `data.frame`. `data.frame`s are the most commonly used data
**structure** in R, and is just a list of equal length vectors. Each vector is
treated as a column and elements of the vectors are rows. A `tibble` is a type 
of data frame that makes data analysis easier, and is part of the `tidyverse`. 

Most often, data frames are constructed by reading in data from an external
file or library, but we can also create them from scratch. Let's create a 
data frame named `df` in the following code, and take a look at the `class` of
the data frame, as well as `glimpse` what's in it. We can also extract elements
of data frames by using the `$` operator. Consider the example below:

```{r data-set, exercise = TRUE}
df <- tibble(x = 1:3,
             y = c("a", "b", "c"))
class(df)
glimpse(df)

attributes(df)
df$x
class(df$x)
class(df$y)
```

## A word of caution

Be careful about data types / classes! Sometimes R makes silly assumptions 
about your data class. Using `tibbles` help, but it might not solve all issues.
Think carefully about your data in context: a 0/1 variable is more likely a
binary variable that should be treated categorically (perhaps as a factor, which
is covered in another `learnr` tutorial in this series).

If a plot or output is not behaving the way you expect, first investigate the
data class. If you are absolutely sure of a data class (and the existing class
is wrong), over-write it in your tibble so that you don't need to keep having to 
keep track of it (perhaps by using `mutate`).
