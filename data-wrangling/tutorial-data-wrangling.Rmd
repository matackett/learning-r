## Tidy data

>*Все счастливые семьи похожи друг на друга, каждая несчастливая семья несчастлива по-своему.*

As Tolstoy write in Anna Karenina, "all happy families are alike; each unhappy 
family is unhappy in its own way." The same is true of tidy data. All *tidy* 
datasets are alike; each untidy dataset is untidy in its own way. The three
characteristics of tidy datasets are as follows:

- Each variable forms a column,
- Each observation forms a row, and
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## Today's dataset

Today's dataset was posted to Kaggle by Mario Tormo Romero, who scraped the data 
from [the Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net) and 
[Serebii](https://www.serebii.net). It has been slightly modified for the 
purposes of this tutorial. 

The dataset contains information on all Pokemon, including alternate forms,
through Generation 8 (Pokemon Sword and Shield). Pokemon have various
characteristics unique to each one. The variables in the `pokemon` dataset are
listed below.

- `pokedex_number`: a catelogue number of each Pokemon
- `generation`: which video game generation the Pokemon is from
- `leg_status`: whether a Pokemon is sub-legendary, legendary, mythical, or none
- `type_1`, `type_2`: what "type" a Pokemon is (fire, water, electric, etc.)
- `bst`: the base stat total of a Pokemon (a proxy for its effectiveness in 
combat)
- `hp`, `atk`, `def`, `spa`, `spd`, `spe`: a Pokemon's battle statistics (HP,
attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed, respectively)

## Introducing dplyr

The `dplyr` package introduces functions as verbs that manipulate data frames,
and is part of the core `tidyverse`. When we run `library(tidyverse)`, the 
`dplyr` package is automatically loaded.

We `dplyr`, we can 
- `glimpse` the entire dataset 
- `filter` for rows matching certain criteria
- `select` columns by name
- `mutate` new variables 
- ... and so much more!

Today's dataset has already been loaded into the environment for you by using
the `read_csv` function in the `tidyverse` using the following code:

```{r eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("data/pokemon.csv")
```

Let's start by taking a `glimpse` of the dataset. Run the following code. What
do you see?

```{r glimpse, exercise = TRUE}
glimpse(pokemon)
```

The `glimpse` gives us a quick glimpse into the main features of the dataset:
the number of observations and variables, as well as each variable, what type it
is, and the first few observations in the dataset.

## The %>% operator

The pipe operator ` %>% ` is used for many data manipulation tasks. You can 
pronounce it as "and then".

Think about the following sequence of actions: 
- Find keys 
- Unlock car 
- Start car 
- Drive to Duke
- Park

Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

When writing functions with `dplyr`, there are a set of rules that must be
followed. The first argument must *always* be a data frame, and `dplyr` 
functions always return data frames (unless specifically told not to). In each
step, we use a series of pipes (`%>%`), which pipe the output of the previous 
line of code as the first input of the next line of code. 

## Logical operators in R

You will commonly need to use the following operators in R to compare different
variables against values or each other:

Operator    | Definition                   
------------|------------------------------
`<`         | less than                    
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        
`>`         | greater than                 
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     
`==`        |	exactly equal to             
`!=`        |	not equal to                 
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  
`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y`  
`is.na(x)`  | test if `x` is `NA`          
`x %in% y`  | test if `x` is in `y`        
`!x`        | not `x`                      

Note that R stores missing values as `NA`.

## Diving into `dplyr`!

We'll now take a look at some of the most commonly used `dplyr` functions. In
each example, try to read the code in "plain English," and see if the output
matches your expectation. The functions in `dplyr` are designed to "make sense,"
if you will. If you still do not know what each function does after looking
at the code and output, check the documentation by typing in `?` followed by the
function in order to look at the documentation. For instance, `?filter`. As well, 
note the use of the logical operators introduced in the previous section.

## `filter`

`filter` can be used to select a subset of rows based on variables in the 
dataset:

```{r filter-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(leg_status == "Legendary")
```

`filter` can also be used to select a subset of rows:

```{r filter-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass")
```

## `select` 

`select` can be used to keep certain *variables* (columns) in the dataset. 
Notice that the following code first filters for grass type Pokemon, *and then*
selects certain variables:

```{r select-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2, height_m, weight_kg)
```

`select` can also be used to exclude variables by adding a `-` in front of the
variables you wish to exclude:

```{r select-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(-pokedex_number, -generation, -leg_status, -type_1, -type_2)
```

Finally, you can `select` a range of variables depending on their position in 
the dataset:

```{r select-3, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe)
```

## `slice` 

`slice` is used to take "slices" of the data based on their row indices:

```{r slice-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
  slice(1, 23)
```

```{r slice-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
  slice(2, 5:8)
```

## `pull`

`pull` is used to extract certain variables (columns) as *vectors* instead of as
dataframes. This comes in handy for certain applications, where we require the
data to be vectors specifically. For now, just know that this is something that
can be done.

```{r pull-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  pull(name)
```

vs.

```{r pull-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  select(name)
```

## `sample_n` and `sample_frac`

`sample_n` and `sample_frac` are used to create random samples (of rows, or
observations) in our dataset based on either the number of observations desired
or by the fraction of the total dataset required. For the purposes of 
reproducible research, it is always good to set a random seed prior to choosing
a random sample so others can reproduce your work.

```{r sample-n, exercise = TRUE}
set.seed(1)
pokemon %>%
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)
```

vs.

```{r sample-frac, exercise = TRUE}
set.seed(12345)
pokemon %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
  sample_frac(0.01, replace = FALSE)
```

## `distinct`

`distinct` allows us to look for unique, or distinct, observations:

```{r distinct, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct()
```

## `arrange`

`arrange` allows us to sort the observations in order, either ascending (by
default) or descending:

```{r arrange-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(type_1)
```

vs.

```{r arrange-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(desc(type_1))
```

## `summarize` 

`summarize` creates new variables based on summary statistics of existing data.
Note that like all `dplyr` output (except `pull`), we get data frames at the
ends of our pipelines. However, in this case we are reducing the data into
summary statistics -- these are *not* individual-level observations anymore!

```{r summarize, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  summarize(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),
            avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))
```

## `group_by` 

Often times in our analysis, we want to perform a task grouped by a certain 
variable. For instance, the following example does the same task as seen on the
previous page for `summarize`, but this time we are are grouping by
`leg_status`. Compare the output from the code below to the one on the previous
page:

```{r group, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  group_by(leg_status) %>%
  summarise(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),
            avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))
```

## `count` 

`count` allows us to count observations in groups:

```{r}
pokemon %>%
  count(leg_status)
```

## `mutate` 

We can create new variables in the dataset by using the `mutate` function. 
Examine the following pipeline of variables. How would you read it in plain
English? We might say

- First, start with pokemon, *and then*
- mutate a new variable `bmi` equal to `weight_kg` divided by `height_m` 
squared, *and then*
- arrange by `bmi` from smallest to largest, *and then*
- slice the first five observations, *and then*
- select the `name` and `bmi` variables

How is the `mutate` function used in the example below?

```{r mutate-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight_kg / height_m^2) %>% 
  arrange(bmi) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(name, bmi)
```

Is the output as you expect?

Note that you can `mutate` many variables into your dataset by separating them
with commas.

## Save new variables for later

It's often the case when when creating new variables, you want to use them in
further analyses down the line. We can use the `<-` operator in R to assign
values. For instance, the following example `mutate`s a new variable `bmi`, and
then overwrites the original `pokemon` dataset.

```{r mutate-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight_kg/height_m^2)

glimpse(pokemon)
```

#### `case_when`

We can also use the `case_when` function to create a new variable with certain
values based on *cases* of another variable *when* it satisfies certain 
conditions. For instance, examine the following example. What is the code
doing?

```{r case-when, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>%
  mutate(bmi_cat = case_when(bmi < 25             ~ "Non-overweight",
                             bmi >= 25 & bmi < 30 ~ "Overweight",
                             bmi >= 30            ~ "Obese")) %>% 
  count(bmi_cat)
```

## On your own!

The following exercises are designed to familiarize you with using logical
operators and `dplyr` pipelines. Try each of the tasks below using a `dplyr`
pipeline and check your answers against the solution for each exercise.

1. Create a data frame that displays the number of Pokemon by their legendary 
status

```{r ex-1, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-1-solution}
pokemon %>%
  count(leg_status)
```

2. Create a data frame that lists all unique type combinations (note that "None" 
is a valid secondary type). Arrange the list in alphabetical order by primary 
type and then by secondary type.

```{r ex-2, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-2-solution}
pokemon %>%
  distinct(type_1, type_2) %>% 
  arrange(type_1, type_2)
```

3. Create a data frame that displays the number of "Legendary" Pokemon by their 
primary type (`type_1`)

```{r ex-3, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-3-solution}
pokemon %>%
  filter(leg_status == "Legendary") %>% 
  count(type_1)
```

4. Create a data frame that displays the "Legendary" Pokemon from generation 4. 
Only display their names, primary type, and secondary type

```{r ex-4, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-4-solution}
pokemon %>%
  filter(leg_status == "Legendary",
         generation == 3) %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2)
```

5. Create a data frame that displays all Pokemon with base stat totals of 600 or 
more that are NOT "Legendary" or "Mythical." Only display the names of the 
Pokemon and their base stat totals, and arrange from highest base stat totals
to lowest.

```{r ex-5, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-5-solution}
pokemon %>%
  filter(leg_status != "Legendary" & 
         leg_status != "Mythical" &
         bst >= 600) %>% 
  select(name, bst) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bst))
```

6. Create a data frame that displays the mean base stat total of Pokemon by 
their primary type. Arrange in order of highest mean base stat total to lowest.

```{r ex-6, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-6-solution}
pokemon %>%
  group_by(type_1) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bst = mean(bst)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_bst))
```

7. Create a new variable named `special` that denotes whether a Pokemon is
special ("Legendary" or "Mythical") or not special ("Not Legendary" or "Sub
Legendary"), then create a data frame which displays the number of special
Pokemon by their primary type, arranged from least to most.

```{r ex-7, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-7-solution}
pokemon %>%
  mutate(special = case_when(leg_status %in% c("Legendary", "Mythical") ~ "Special",
                             leg_status %in% c("Not Legendary", "Sub Legendary") ~ "Not special")) %>% 
  group_by(type_1) %>% 
  count(special) %>% 
  filter(special == "Special") %>% 
  arrange(n)
```

8. Create a new variable which depicts whether a pokemon is "offensive," 
"defensive," or "balanced." An offensive Pokemon has attack + special attack
greater than defense + special defense, and vice-versa for a defense Pokemon.
A balanced Pokemon has attack + special attack equal to defense + special 
defense. Save this new variable into your dataset (we will be using it
again later!). <br><br>
In a separate pipeline, create a data frame which counts the number
of offensive, defensive, and balanced Pokemon.

```{r ex-8, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 

pokemon %>% 
```

```{r ex-8-solution}
pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  mutate(odb = case_when(atk + spa > def + spd ~ "Offensive",
                         atk + spa < def + spd ~ "Defensive",
                         atk + spa == def + spd ~ "Balanced"))
pokemon %>% 
  count(odb)
```


9. Suppose all Pokemon are perfect spheres with diameter equal to their heights.
Calculate each Pokemon's density. Create a data frame which lists only the 
Pokemon whose spherical forms would sink in water (density of 1000 kilograms per
cubic meter), arranged from the most dense to the least dense. In your data 
frame, display only the Pokemon's name, its density, and primary and secondary 
types. The formula for the volume of a sphere is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.<br><br>
Is anything surprising?

```{r ex-9, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 

```

```{r ex-9-solution}
pokemon %>%
  mutate(vol = 4/3*pi*(height_m/2)^3,
         density = weight_kg/vol) %>% 
  filter(density > 1000) %>% 
  arrange(desc(density)) %>% 
  select(name, density, type_1, type_2)

# As it turns out, all Pokemon, if they were spherical, would float on water,
# with the exception of the 14 Pokemon displayed above! Yes, Cosmoem IS that
# dense (and is actually pretty spherical!)
```

10. Use `dplyr` pipelines to perform an investigation of your choice in the
`pokemon` dataset. What insight(s) or observation(s) can you find as a result
of your data wrangling?

```{r ex-10, exercise = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  
```
