**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

**Characteristics of untidy data:**

...each is untidy in its own way.]

### Pokemon dataset

This dataset was posted by Kaggle by Mario Tormo Romero, who scraped the data from [the Pokemon Database](https://pokemondb.net) and [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net). It has been slightly modified for the purposes of this class.

```{r load-data, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
pokemon <- read_csv("data/pokemon.csv")
```

--

The dataset contains information on all Pokemon, including alternate forms, through Generation 8 (Pokemon Sword and Shield).

### A grammar of data manipulation


.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
<br><br><br>
The `dplyr` package introduces functions as verbs that manipulate data frames.
For instance, we can 
- `glimpse` the entire dataset 
- `filter` for rows matching certain criteria
- `select` columns by name
- `mutate` new variables 
- ... and so many more!
]

---

### Taking a `glimpse` of the dataset

```{r}
glimpse(pokemon)
```

.question[
What do you notice in the output?
]

---

### The pipe operator ` %>% ` =

The pipe operator ` %>% ` is used for many data manipulation tasks. You can 
pronounce it as "and then".

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/magritte.jpg")
```

---

### How does a pipe work?

Think about the following sequence of actions: 
- Find keys 
- Unlock car 
- Start car 
- Drive to Duke
- Park

Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:
```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

--

Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

### `dplyr` rules for functions

- The first argument must *always* be a data frame

- The `%>%` operator "pipes" the output of the previous line of code as the 
first input of the next line of code

- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

- `dplyr` functions always return a data frame (unless specifically told not to)

- A good practice is to avoid modifying "in place"

### Logical operators in R

operator    | definition                   
------------|------------------------------
`<`         | less than                    
`<=`        |	less than or equal to        
`>`         | greater than                 
`>=`        |	greater than or equal to     
`==`        |	exactly equal to             
`!=`        |	not equal to                 
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  
`x`&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;`y`     | `x` OR `y`  
`is.na(x)`  | test if `x` is `NA`          
`x %in% y`  | test if `x` is in `y`        
`!x`        | not `x`

# Data wrangling examples

### `filter` to select a subset of rows

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{filter(leg_status == "Legendary")}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(leg_status == "Legendary")
```

---

### `filter` to select a subset of rows

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass")}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass")
```

---

### `select` to keep variables

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
 {{select(name, type_1, type_2, height_m, weight_kg)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2, height_m, weight_kg)
```

---

### `select` to exclude variables

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
 {{select(-pokedex_number, -generation, -leg_status, -type_1, -type_2)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(-pokedex_number, -generation, -leg_status, -type_1, -type_2)
```

---

### `select` a range of variables

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
 {{select(name, bst:spe)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe)
```

---

### `slice` certain row indices

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
 {{slice(1, 23)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
  slice(1, 23)
```

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
 {{slice(2, 5:8)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Grass" | type_2 == "Grass") %>% 
  select(name, bst:spe) %>% 
  slice(2, 5:8)
```

---

### `pull` a column as a vector

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
 {{pull(name)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  pull(name)
```

vs.

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
 {{select(name)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  slice(1:3) %>%
  select(name)
```

---

### `sample_n` observations

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
 {{sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(1)
pokemon %>%
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
  sample_n(5, replace = FALSE)
```

---

### `sample_frac` observations

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
 {{sample_frac(0.01, replace = FALSE)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(123)
pokemon %>% 
  select(name, type_1, type_2) %>% 
  sample_frac(0.01, replace = FALSE)
```

---

### Look for `distinct` observations

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
 {{distinct()}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct()
```

---

### `arrange` observations

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
 {{arrange(type_1)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(type_1)
```

---

### `arrange` in descending order

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
 {{arrange(desc(type_1))}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>% 
  select(type_1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(desc(type_1))
```

---

### `summarize` statistics in the dataset

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{summarize(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),}}
           {{avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  summarize(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),
            avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))
```

---

### `group_by` certain variables

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{group_by(leg_status) %>%}}
  summarise(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),
            avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  group_by(leg_status) %>%
  summarise(avg_ht = mean(height_m, na.rm = T),
            avg_wt = mean(weight_kg, na.rm = T))
```

---

### `count` observations in groups

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{count(leg_status)}}
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  count(leg_status)
```

---

### `mutate` new variables to the dataset

```{r, eval = F}
pokemon %>% 
 {{mutate(bmi = weight_kg/height_m^2) %>%}}
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(name, bmi) %>% 
  arrange(bmi)
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight_kg/height_m^2) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(name, bmi) %>% 
  arrange(bmi)
```

---

### Save new variables for later

```{r, eval = F}
{{pokemon <- pokemon %>% }}
  mutate(bmi = weight_kg/height_m^2)}}

glimpse(pokemon)
```
```{r, echo = F}
pokemon <- pokemon %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight_kg/height_m^2)
glimpse(pokemon)
```

---

### `mutate` new variables to the dataset

```{r eval = F}
pokemon %>%
 {{mutate(bmi_cat = case_when(bmi < 25             ~ "Non-overweight",}}
                            {{bmi >= 25 & bmi < 30 ~ "Overweight",}}
                            {{bmi >= 30            ~ "Obese")) %>% }}
  count(bmi_cat)
```
```{r echo = F}
pokemon %>%
  mutate(bmi_cat = case_when(bmi < 25             ~ "Non-overweight",
                             bmi >= 25 & bmi < 30 ~ "Overweight",
                             bmi >= 30            ~ "Obese")) %>% 
  count(bmi_cat)
```
