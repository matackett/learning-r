## Spatial Data

This tutorial will teach you how to visualize spatial data (i.e., geographic data) in `ggplot2`. Let's make some maps!

## Reading Spatial Data into R

Spatial files are stored in shapefiles (.shp). Using the sf package and the `st_read` command, we can look at a dataset in R for North Carolina's 100 counties. Notice here that x and y apply to the longitude and latitude of a county. This particular data set has information on the number of live births by county in several years in the 1970s.

```{r sf, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)
nc
```

## Making Maps in R

You can use `ggplot()` to plot maps in R. If you add the command `geom_sf()`, a map of North Carolina and its 100 counties appears.
```{r ncmap, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf()
```

You can also add a theme to your map and outline the county borders in color.
```{r themecolors, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(color = "slateblue") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

You can change the size of the outline or fill in the counties by using the size and fill options inside `geom_sf` If you want it to be shaded more lightly, you can specify with by setting `alpha` equal to a smaller value as I do below.

```{r themecolors2, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(color = "slateblue", size = 2, alpha = 0.7, fill = "orange") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

## Choropeth Maps

Sometimes, you will want to plot a variable by a geographic unit. To do this, you can make a choropeth map. Below, I make a map of county births in 1974 by county by indicating the name of the variable I want to map inside `aes` by setting `fill` equal to this variable.

```{r fill, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = BIR74)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

It may sometimes help to pick diverging colors; a [guide](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=PiYG&n=3) to colors that divege (with options that are color-blind friendly) are available here.

```{r gradient, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5}
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = BIR74)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#e9a3c9", high = "#a1d76a") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

## Quiz

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which kind of file do you need to make a map in R with ggplot?",
    answer(".GAL"),
    answer(".SHP", correct = TRUE),
    answer(".dta"),
    answer(".nb2"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
    ),
   question("True or False: you use aes(fill=) to make a choropeth map?",
    answer("True", correct= TRUE),
    answer("False",),
    allow_retry = TRUE
    )
)
