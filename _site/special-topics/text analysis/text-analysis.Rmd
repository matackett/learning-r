# Tidytext analysis

#### Packages

In addition to `tidyverse` we will be using a few other packages today

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(genius) # https://github.com/JosiahParry/genius
```

---

### Tidytext

- Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more 
effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use.

- Learn more at https://www.tidytextmining.com/.

### What is tidy text?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
text <- c("On your mark ready set let's go", 
          "dance floor pro",
          "I know you know I go psycho", 
          "When my new joint hit", 
          "just can't sit",
          "Got to get jiggy wit it", 
          "ooh, that's it")

text
```

---

### What is tidy text?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
text_df <- tibble(line = 1:7, text = text)

text_df
```

---

### What is tidy text?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

---

### Let's get some data

We'll use the `genius` package to get song lyric data from [Genius](https://genius.com/).

- `genius_album()` allows you to download the lyrics for an entire album in a 
tidy format. 

- Input: Two arguments: artist and album. Supply the quoted name of artist 
and the album (if it gives you issues check that you have the album name and 
artists as specified on [Genius](https://genius.com/)).

- Output: A tidy data frame with three columns corresponding to the track name, 
the track number, and lyrics

```{r, message = F, warning = F, cache=TRUE}
ariana <- genius_album(
  artist = "Ariana Grande", 
  album = "thank you, next"
  )

national <- genius_album(
  artist = "The National",
  album = "I Am Easy to Find"
)
```

### Ariana Grande vs. The National

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '90%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/ariana.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = '90%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("img/national.png")
```
]

### Save for later

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana <- ariana  %>% 
  mutate(
  artist = "Ariana Grande", 
  album = "thank you, next"
)

national <- national %>% 
  mutate(
  artist = "The National",
  album = "I Am Easy to Find"
)

```

```{r, message = F, warning = F}

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana_lyrics <- ariana %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric)

national_lyrics <- national %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric)
```

### What are the most common words?

.pull-left[
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana_lyrics %>%

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
national_lyrics %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```
]

---

### Stop words

- In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after 
processing of natural language data (text).

- They usually refer to the most common words in a language, but there is not a 
single list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools.

See `?get_stopwords` for more info.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
get_stopwords(source = "smart")
```

---

### What are the most common words?

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
stopwords <- get_stopwords(source = "smart") %>% 
  select(word) %>% 
  pull()
```

.pull-left[
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana_lyrics %>%
  filter(!(word %in% stopwords)) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana_lyrics %>%
  filter(!(word %in% stopwords)) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```
]

### What are the most common words?

```{r, eval=FALSE}

### Sentiment analysis

- One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a 
combination of its individual words 

- The sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of
the individual words

- The sentiment attached to each word is given by a *lexicon*, which may be 
downloaded from external sources

---

### Sentiment lexicons

.pull-left[
```{r}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
get_sentiments("bing") 
```
]

---

### Sentiment lexicons

.pull-left[
```{r}
get_sentiments("nrc")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
get_sentiments("loughran") 
```
]

---

### Notes about sentiment lexicons

- Not every word is in a lexicon!

```{r}
get_sentiments("bing") %>% 
  filter(word == "data")
```

- Lexicons do not account for qualifiers before a word (e.g., "not happy") 
because they were constructed for one-word tokens only

- Summing up each word's sentiment may result in a neutral sentiment, even if 
there are strong positive and negative sentiments in the body

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
ariana_lyrics %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%

national_lyrics %>%
