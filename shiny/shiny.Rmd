Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight 
from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown 
documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS 
themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions. To get an idea of Shiny's 
capabilities check our the Shiny gallery at https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/.

This tutorial serves as a gentle introduction to Shiny and covers the 
essentials in Shiny's 
[*Part 1 - How to build a Shiny app*](https://vimeo.com/131218530) video. 
For advanced Shiny topics and concepts, check out Shiny's own tutorial and
resources at https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/. 

### Packages

The following packages have been loaded in this tutorial:

```{r}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Getting started

Instead of coding in an R Markdown file, you will develop your Shiny app
in a script, `.R`, file. To get started

1. open RStudio;

2. if not installed, run `install.packages("shiny")`;

3. go to `File` `>` `New File` `>` `Shiny Web App`;

4. enter your application's name;

5. keep option Single File (app.R) selected;

6. enter the directory of where the application should be saved;

7. a file `app.R` should open. This is a 
   template app that serves as a good starting point.
   
The template app uses a dataset named `faithful` that is available in the `base`
package of R. This dataset contains waiting times between eruptions and the 
duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National 
Park, Wyoming, USA. Variables `eruptions` and `waiting` are both in minutes.
This tutorial will build on the template app as a way to introduce key 
components of Shiny.

Click the `Run App` button. Your template app should look similar to what 
you see below.

### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### App

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
  x    <- faithful[, 2]
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```

#### Code

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


## Shiny framework

A Shiny app is comprised of two main parts: a **user interface (ui)** and a set 
of **server** instructions. These exist together in a single file named `app.R`.

### User interface (UI)

The user interface of a Shiny app controls the layout, positioning of items, and
overall appearance of your app. This is what users see when they interact with
your app. Generally, the UI will consist of a collection of input widgets and
output displays. In the *Old Faithful Geyser Data* app from last section, there
was one input widget (slider input) and one output display (plot). Shiny apps
can also support action buttons, multiple tabs or pages, themes, and much more.

The user interface is built with HTML. The package `shiny` has
helpful wrapper functions that facilitate app development without a deep
understanding of HTML. For example, the slider widget from the
*Old Faithful Geyser Data* app was created with the R function `sliderInput()`.
Run the code below to see how this creates a slider widget. The corresponding
HTML is given further below.

```{r slider_demo, exercise=TRUE}
sliderInput(inputId = "bins", label = "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
```

```html
<div class="form-group shiny-input-container">
  <label class="control-label" for="bins">Number of bins:</label>
  <input class="js-range-slider" id="bins" data-min="1" data-max="50" data-from="30" data-step="1" data-grid="true" data-grid-num="9.8" data-grid-snap="false" data-prettify-separator="," data-prettify-enabled="true" data-keyboard="true" data-data-type="number"/>
</div>
```

Rather than having to master a lot of fancy HTML, you only need to know the R
functions available to create specific widgets. `shiny` has structured these
functions in such a way that is makes it relatively easy to build a fancy UI.

### Server

Every Shiny app is maintained by a computer running R. This could be your
own computer (see Figure 1) or a remote server (see Figure 2). 
When you develop your app, your computer will
run a session of R. When you go to publish your app, a remote server will
serve as the computer running the R session.

<figcaption>Figure 2: Shiny app on remote server</figcaption>
</center>
</figure>

<br/>

The server provides a set of R instructions for how the app should react to
user actions. These instructions live inside the `server()` function of the
Shiny app framework. As you change the value of the slider widget in the 
template app, a set of R code in the server function takes that value and 
replots the histogram.

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins_2",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot_2")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_2 <- renderPlot({
  x    <- faithful[, 2]
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins_2 + 1)

  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```

The R server code uses the input Id name of the input widgets as way to
reference the current value of the widget. In this example, the value for the
number of bins for the histogram is connected through the input Id of `"bins"`.

### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### User interface

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label   = "Number of bins:",
                        min     = 1,
                        max     = 50,
                        value   = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

#### Server

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}
```

### {-}

Once the `ui` object is defined and the `server()` function is created, both are
passed into the function `shinyApp()` to create the Shiny application.

## Input widgets

### Prerequisites

You'll go through adding some enhancements to your template app to learn more 
about the input widgets Shiny offers. Before you get started, update your 
histogram with a `ggplot`-style histogram. Remove everything inside 
`renderPlot({})` of your server function and replace it with

```{r eval=FALSE}
faithful %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_3, fill = "red", color = "black", alpha = .3) +
  labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

Don't forget to load `tidyverse`. 
Run you app. It should now look similar to the app below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins_3",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot_3")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_3 <- renderPlot({
  faithful %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_3, fill = "red", color = "black", alpha = .3) +
    labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
})
```

### Available widgets

Check out the 
[Shiny Widgets Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html) 
to see some of the available widgets. Each
of these has two common arguments: `inputId` and `label`. The `inputID` takes
a character value that will be used internally to access the value of the
widget. The `label` is the displayed value for the widget in the user
interface. It is what users will see when they interact with your app.
All other arguments are widget-specific. Always look at the help when
working with a new widget.

### Select input {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Instructions

<br/>

In the user interface after `sliderInput()`, add a select input box to your 
user interface. Include colors “Red”, “Blue”, “Green”, “Grey”, with “Red” as 
the default color. Look at the help for function `selectInput()`. After you 
make the changes, run your app.

*You'll need a comma to separate input widgets.*

#### Widget

<br/>

```{r select_input_widget, exercise=TRUE}
selectInput(inputId = "fill_color", label = "Fill color", 
            choices = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
            selected = "Red")
```

#### App

<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins_4",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30),
            
            selectInput(inputId  = "fill_color", 
                        label    = "Fill color", 
                        choices  = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
                        selected = "Red")
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot_4")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_4 <- renderPlot({
  faithful %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_4, fill = "red", color = "black", alpha = .3) +
    labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
})
```

#### Updated user interface

<br/>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label   = "Number of bins:",
                        min     = 1,
                        max     = 50,
                        value   = 30),
            
            selectInput(inputId  = "fill_color", 
                        label    = "Fill color", 
                        choices  = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
                        selected = "Red")
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

### Check box {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Instructions

<br/>

Update the user interface to include a check box that reads “Preview data”. 
Place this below the select input box. Set the default for the check box to be 
unchecked. Type `?checkboxInput` in your Console for help. After you make the 
changes, run your app.

*You'll need a comma to separate input widgets.*

#### Widget

<br/>

```{r checkbox_widget, exercise=TRUE}
checkboxInput(inputId = "check_box", label = "Preview data", value = FALSE)
```

#### App

<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins_5",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30),
            
            selectInput(inputId  = "fill_color_2", 
                        label    = "Fill color", 
                        choices  = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
                        selected = "Red"),
            
            checkboxInput(inputId = "check_box", 
                          label   = "Preview data", 
                          value   = FALSE)
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot_5")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_5 <- renderPlot({
  faithful %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_5, fill = "red", color = "black", alpha = .3) +
    labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
})
```

#### Updated user interface

<br/>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                        label   = "Number of bins:",
                        min     = 1,
                        max     = 50,
                        value   = 30),
            
            selectInput(inputId  = "fill_color", 
                        label    = "Fill color", 
                        choices  = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
                        selected = "Red"),
            
            checkboxInput(inputId = "check_box", 
                          label   = "Preview data", 
                          value   = FALSE)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

### {-}

As you may have noticed, changing the fill color in the select box from Red to
Blue does not change the color of the rectangles in the histogram, yet. 
Likewise, checking "Preview data" has no affect on the app. In the next 
section, you'll link these newly created widgets to R code in the server 
function to enable reactivity.

## Display reactive output

### Prerequisites

Update the user interface to include space for a data table to be output below
the histogram. Use function `dataTableOutput()` inside function `mainPanel()` 
and below `plotOutput()`. All you need to provide in `dataTableOutput()` is
an `outputId` value that will be used in the server function.
Separate functions `plotOutput()` and `dataTableOutput()` with a comma.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mainPanel(
   plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot"),
   dataTableOutput(outputId = "datatable")
)
```

After you make the changes, run your app. You should see no changes in the 
user interface. All you have done is allocate space in your user interface for 
a data table to be displayed.

### Server function

Including `plotOutput()` and `dataTableOutput()` in the user interface tells
Shiny where to position these objects. To tell Shiny how to create these objects
you'll need to provide R code in the server function.

The `server` function plays a special role in the Shiny process; it builds a 
list-like object named `output` that contains all of the code needed to update 
the R objects in your app. Each R object needs to have its own entry in the 
list. Your template app currently has one entry, `output$distPlot`.

Each output entry is connected with a `render*()` function. These render
functions allow you to incorporate the reactive values from widgets into your
R code. There is a connection between the render function you use and the
output you want to display.

| Output function in UI| Creates   |
|----------------------|-----------|
| `dataTableOutput`    | DataTable |
| `htmlOutput`         | raw HTML  |
| `imageOutput`        | image     |
| `plotOutput`         | plot      |
| `tableOutput`        | table     |
| `textOutput`         | text      |
| `uiOutput`           | raw HTML  |
| `verbatimTextOutput` | text      |

| Render function in server  | Creates                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `renderDataTable`          | DataTable                                       |
| `renderImage`              | images (saved as a link to a source file)       |
| `renderPlot`               | plots                                           |
| `renderPrint`              | any printed output                              |
| `renderTable`              | data frame, matrix, other table like structures |
| `renderText`               | character strings                               |
| `renderUI`                 | a Shiny tag object or HTML                      |

### Use widget values

In the `server` function, `input` is another list-like object. It holds all the
values of the widgets in your app. To access these values inside a render
function, use the form `input$<id_for_widget>`; where `<id_for_widget>` is
replaced with the widget Id you used in your UI. For example, to reference
the slider input's value in a render function, use `input$bins`. This is
how you create reactivity in your Shiny app and connect the inputs to the
outputs. 

<div class="info">
**Note!** Keep in mind that these reactive values can only be used in
reactive style functions within your server function. The render functions
are one set of functions that support reactive values.
</div>

### Connect fill color {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Instructions

<br/>

Update the `renderPlot()` component of the server function so the histogram's
fill color will change when a new fill color is selected from the select input
widget.

#### App

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_6 <- renderPlot({
  faithful %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_6, fill = input$fill_color_3, 
                   color = "black", alpha = .3) +
    labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
})
```

#### Updated server function

<br/>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    faithful %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = input$bins, fill = input$fill_color, 
                     color = "black", alpha = .3) +
      labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
      theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
  })
}
```

### Connect data preview {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### Instructions

<br/>

Update the server function so six random rows of `faithful` will be displayed 
below the histogram when “Preview data” is checked. 
Use function `renderDataTable()`.

#### App

<br/>

```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidPage(
  
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins_7",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30),
            
            selectInput(inputId  = "fill_color_4", 
                        label    = "Fill color", 
                        choices  = c("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Grey"),
                        selected = "Red"),
            
            checkboxInput(inputId = "check_box_3", 
                          label   = "Preview data", 
                          value   = FALSE)
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot_7"),
           dataTableOutput(outputId = "datatable_2")
        )
    )
)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, context="server"}
output$distPlot_7 <- renderPlot({
  faithful %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = input$bins_7, fill = input$fill_color_4, 
                   color = "black", alpha = .3) +
    labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
})

output$datatable_2 <- renderDataTable({
  if (input$check_box_3) {
    faithful %>% 
      sample_n(size = 6)
  }
})
```

#### Updated server function

<br/>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    faithful %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = waiting)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = input$bins, fill = input$fill_color, 
                     color = "black", alpha = .3) +
      labs(x = "Waiting time", y = "Frequency", title = "Old Faithful Geyser") +
      theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
  })
  
  output$datatable <- renderDataTable({
    if (input$check_box) {
      faithful %>% 
        sample_n(size = 6)
    }
  })
}
```
