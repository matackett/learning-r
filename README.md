## Instructions for deploying the tutorials:

- If you're not on campus, connect to VPN
- Clone the learning-r repo and open in RStudio
- Open the tutorial you're interested in (folder should coincide with the section headers)
- Click "Run Document" just to make sure it runs 
- Click the blue "Publish to Server" button on the top right of the editor window. 
- If this is your first time, click "Add new account" in the pop-up box and add the name of the server. It should now show up as an option in the "Publish to Account" box. - In the list of files, click "uncheck all" if any of the files are checked. Then click "Add More" and navigate to the app you want to deploy. 
- If the app reads in a data set, you'll need to repeat the process to add the appropriate data set.
- For the title, you can use the same title at the end of the links in the _site.yml menu. Hopefully that way you don't have to update the link names. Just note whatever you put in the title will be coverted to the link name.
