We use models to explain the relationship between variables and to make 
predictions. For now we will focus on **linear** models (but remember there are 
other types of models too!)

Today, we will focus on fitting and interpreting models with a continuous 
outcome variable and a single predictor. To do so, we will use the `broom` 
package, which takes the messy output of built-in functions in R and turns 
them into tidy data frames. As expected, it integrates well with the tidyverse, especially with data wrangling using `dplyr`.

```{r, out.width = "30%", echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/broom.png")
```

## Today's data

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/beijing1.png")
```
Today's data are come from a series of atmospheric measurements taken at the
Agriculture Exhibition Hall in Beijing from 2013 - 2017. The following variables
are in the dataset:

- `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`: when the observation was taken
- `PM2.5` and `PM10`: levels of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, in
$\mu$g/m$^3$
- `SO2`, `NO2`, `CO`, `O3`: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide,
and ozone concentrations, in $\mu$g/m$^3$, respectivel
- `TEMP`: temperature, in degrees C
- `PRES`: barometric pressure, in hPa
- `DEWP`: dew point temperature, in degrees C
- `RAIN`: precipitation levels, in mm
- `wd`: wind direction (eight compass directions)
- `SWPM`: wind speed, in m/s

These data are adapted from a dataset released by Song Xi Chen as referenced in
Zhang S., et al (2017), Proc. Royal Soc. A. Let's explore some of these data. 

1. Describe the distribution of dew point as measured at this station (in 
degrees C):

```{r, fig.height=2.5, echo = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = DEWP)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(y = "Count")
```

2. Describe the distribution of barometric pressure (in hectopascals):

```{r, fig.height=2.5, echo = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(y = "Count")
```

## Models as functions

We can represent relationships between variables using **functions**. A function
in the *mathematical* sense is the relationship between one or more inputs and 
an output created from that (those) input(s). Essentially, we can "plug in" the 
inputs and receive back the output.
    
For instance, the formula $y = 3x + 7$ is a function with input $x$ and output 
$y$. When $x$ is $5$, the output $y$ is $22$:
    
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 3*x + 7

y
```

In statistical models, the **response variable** (dependent variable, or outcome
variable) is the variable whose behavior or variation we are trying to 
understand, and is generally denoted by $y$. The **explanatory variable** 
(independent variable, or predictor variable) is the variable we want to use to
explain the variation in the response, generally denoted by $x$.

3. Examine the following plot, which depicts the relationship between PM2.5 
levels and wind speed. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r, message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(c(-40, 30))
```

4. Now let's overlay a line on this relationship. What are the response and 
explanatory variables?  Does the line describe the relationship between these 
two variables "well"?

```{r, message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  ylim(c(-40, 30))
```

The blue line is a function that we can use to obtain **predicted values** of
our response given values of our predictors. These predicted values are the 
output of the **model function**. That is, the expected value of the response 
*given* a certain value of the explanatory variable. However, we know that there
is variability around our prediction (compare the line to the actual values).
The **residual** is the difference between the actual observed value of the
response variable *observed* in the dataset vs. the value *predicted* by the 
model. It is essentially the vertical distance between each point and the line.

5. What does a negative residual mean? Which points on the plot above have 
negative residuals?

## Interpreting linear models

As previously mentioned, we will be using the 
[`broom` package](https://broom.tidyverse.org/). Some of the most commonly used 
functions are as follows:

- **`tidy`**: Constructs a tidy data frame summarizing model's statistical findings
- **`glance`**: Constructs a concise one-row summary of the model
- **`augment`**: Adds columns (e.g. predictions, residuals) to the original data that was modeled

Today, we will focus on making `tidy` regression output for linear models and
`glance`ing at a model summary.

Let's create a linear model that predicts the dew point given the current 
barometric pressure. We first use the `lm` function to create a **l**inear 
**m**odel object. Let's create and save a model, `mod1`, for use in later 
downstream analyses:

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(DEWP ~ PRES, data = beijing)
```

Now let's take a look at the `tidy` output for our object as provided by the
`broom` package:

```{r}
tidy(mod1)
```

We write the fitted model as follows:

$$\widehat{DEWP} = 1071 - 1.08 PRES$$

That is, the predicted dew point in degrees Celsius is given by 1071 minus 1.08 
times the barometric pressure. We can interpret the intercept and slope 
coefficients as follows:

- **Intercept**: if the barometric pressure is 0, we would expect the dew point 
to be 1071 degrees Celsius, on average (is this a meaningful quantity to 
estimate...?)

- **Slope**: for each additional hectopascal of barometric pressure, we would 
expect the dew point to decrease by 1.08 degrees Celsius

Note that we "expect" these relationships to hold, but there will be some 
variability!

In general, we assume the following underlying simple linear model for a single
predictor and a single continuous outcome:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$

$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are **parameters** which aren't observed (neither is 
the error, $\epsilon_i$). When we estimate these parameters, we denote these 
estimates with hats: $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$. We often use 
**ordinary least squares** (OLS) to obtain these estimates to get the **fitted** 
model

$$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i$$

6. What is different between the underlying linear model and the fitted model?

Remember that residuals are the differences between the observed response and 
the predicted response values from the model:

$$\hat{\epsilon_i} = y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i) = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$

OLS selects $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ such that the sum of squared 
residuals is minimized. The residuals are given by the red segments in the 
graphic below:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
d <- tibble(
    PRES     = mod1$model$PRES,
    DEWP    = mod1$model$DEWP,
    pred         = mod1$fitted.values,
    res          = mod1$residuals
  )
p <- ggplot(data = d, mapping = aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = pred), alpha = 0) +
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = PRES, yend = pred), alpha = 0.4, color="red") +
  labs(x = "Pressure (hPa)", y = "Dew point (C)")
p
```


## Statistical inference

```{r, echo = F}
tidy(mod1)
```

You might have noticed a p-value corresponding to each of the parameter 
estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ In regression models, p-values 
generally correspond to testing the null hypothesis $$H_0: \beta = 0$$ vs. the 
alternative hypothesis $$H_1: \beta \neq 0$$. 

7. At the $\alpha = 0.05$ level, is there sufficient evidence to suggest that 
$\beta_0 \neq 0$? How about $\beta_1$?

We can also get model-level summaries by using the `glance` function on our
model object:

```{r}
glance(mod1)
```

$R^2$ (`r.squared` in the `glance` output) tells us the percentage of 
variability in the response variable that explained by our predictors. In our 
example, We see that approximately 60% of the variability in dew point can be 
explained by its linear relationship with barometric pressure.

## Categorical predictors?

Let's fit a linear regression model using the categorical variable `wd` (wind
direction), which takes on eight values corresponding to the compass points.

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(DEWP ~ wd, data = beijing)
tidy(mod2)
```

8. What do you think these "slopes" correspond to? Why are there only seven wind 
directions in the output but eight in total? what happened to wind coming from 
the east?

When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, the levels are 
encoded as **dummy variables**. Dummy variables take values of either 0 or 1, 
depending on whether the condition it corresponds to is satisfied. For instance,
`wdS` takes on the value of 1 if the wind comes from the south, and 0 if it does 
not. Each coefficient describes the expected difference in dew point when wind 
comes from that particular direction compared to the baseline level (east).

Our fitted/predicted model is given by

\begin{align*}
\widehat{DEWP} &= 5.93 - 8.17N - 3.84NE - 12.55NW + \\
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} 1.95S + 0.31SE -2.10SW - 5.41W
\end{align*}
where the predictors correspond to dummy variables for if the wind is blowing 
from that direction.

9. Using the tidy model output above, is there sufficient evidence to suggest 
differences in dew point depending on wind direction? What patterns do you see?
