### The language of models

---

### Modeling

- We use models to explain the relationship between variables and to make 
predictions

- For now we will focus on **linear** models (but remember there are other types 
of models too!)

- Today, we will focus on fitting and interpreting models with a continuous 
outcome variable and a single predictor

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/broom.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- The broom package takes the messy output of built-in functions in R  and turns 
them into tidy data frames.

- It integrates well with the tidyverse, especially with data wrangling using
`dplyr`

include_graphics("img/beijing1.png")
```

### Dew point

.question[
Describe the distribution of dew point as measured at this station (in degrees
Celsius)
]

```{r, fig.height=2.5, echo = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = DEWP)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(y = "Count")
```

---

### Wind speed

.question[
Describe the distribution of barometric pressure as measured at this station
(in hectopascals)
]

```{r, fig.height=2.5, echo = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(y = "Count")
```

---


### Models as functions

- We can represent relationships between variables using functions

- A <font class = "vocab">function</font> in the *mathematical* sense is the 
relationship between one or more inputs and an output created from that (those) 
input(s). 

- Plug in the inputs and receive back the output
    
--

- For instance, the formula $y = 3x + 7$ is a function with input $x$ and 
output $y$. When $x$ is $5$, the output $y$ is $22$:
    
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 3*x + 7

y
```

### Dew point as a function of pressure

.question[
Describe the relationship between PM2.5 levels and wind speed. 
]

```{r, message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(c(-40, 30))
```

---

### Visualizing the linear model

.question[
What is the input/output? Does the line describe the relationship "well"?
]

```{r, message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  ylim(c(-40, 30))
```

---

### Vocabulary

- <font class = "vocab">Response</font> variable: Variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to
understand, on the y-axis (dependent variable, or outcome)

--

- <font class = "vocab">Explanatory</font> variable: The variable you want to use to explain the 
variation in the response, on the x-axis (independent variables, or predictors)

--

- <font class = "vocab">Predicted value</font>: The output of the <font class = "vocab">model function</font>. That is, the 
expected value of the response *given* a certain value of the explanatory
variable

--

- **Residual**: The difference between the actual value of the response variable
*observed* in the dataset vs. the value *predicted* by the model

---

### Residuals

.question[
What does a negative residual mean? Which points on the plot have 
have negative residuals?
]

```{r, message = F, warning = F, echo = F}
ggplot(data = beijing, aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  ylim(c(-40, 30))

### `broom `

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = "70%", echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/broom.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- **`broom`** follows tidyverse principles and tidies up regression output
- **`tidy`**: Constructs a tidy data frame summarizing model's statistical findings
- **`glance`**: Constructs a concise one-row summary of the model
- **`augment`**: Adds columns (e.g. predictions, residuals) to the original data that was modeled
]

Today, we will focus on making `tidy` regression output for linear models and
`glance`ing at a model summary.

### Fitting our model

Let's create a linear model that predicts the dew point given the current 
barometric pressure.

We first use the `lm` function to create a **l**inear **m**odel object. Let's
create and save a model, `mod1`, for use in later downstream analyses:

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(DEWP ~ PRES, data = beijing)
```

Now let's take a look at the `tidy` output for our object as provided by the
`broom` package:

```{r}
tidy(mod1)
```

---

### Interpreting the slope and intercept

```{r, echo = F}
tidy(mod1)
```

$$\widehat{DEWP} = 1071 - 1.08 PRES$$

The predicted dew point in degrees Celsius is given by 1071 minus 1.08 times the 
barometric pressure.

- <font class = "vocab">Intercept</font>: if the barometric pressure is 0, we 
would expect the dew point to be 1071 degrees Celsius, on average (is this a 
meaningful quantity to estimate...?)

- <font class = "vocab">Slope</font>: for each additional hectopascal of 
barometric pressure, we would expect the dew point to decrease by 1.08 degrees 
Celsius

**Warning**: We "expect" these relationships to hold, but there will be some 
variability!

---

### The simple linear model

We assume the following underlying linear model:

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$

- $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are **parameters** which aren't observed (neither is 
the error, $\epsilon_i$).

- When we estimate these parameters, we denote these estimates with hats: 
$\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$

- We often use <font class = "vocab">ordinary least squares</font> (OLS) to 
obtain these estimates to get the fitted model

$$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i$$

.question[
What is different between the underlying linear model and the fitted model?
]

---

### Ordinary least squares

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
d <- tibble(
    PRES     = mod1$model$PRES,
    DEWP    = mod1$model$DEWP,
    pred         = mod1$fitted.values,
    res          = mod1$residuals
  )
p <- ggplot(data = d, mapping = aes(x = PRES, y = DEWP)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = pred), alpha = 0) +
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = PRES, yend = pred), alpha = 0.4, color="red") +
  labs(x = "Pressure (hPa)", y = "Dew point (C)")
p
```

**Review**: Residuals are the differences between the observed response and 
the predicted response values from the model:

$$\hat{\epsilon_i} = y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_i) = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$

OLS selects $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ such that the sum of squared 
residuals is minimized

---

### Statistical inference

```{r, echo = F}
tidy(mod1)
```

You might have noticed a p-value corresponding to each of the parameter 
estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$

In regression models, p-values generally correspond to testing the null 
hypothesis $$\beta = 0$$ vs. the alternative hypothesis $$\beta \neq 0$$.
.question[
At the $\alpha = 0.05$ level, is there sufficient evidence to suggest that 
$\beta_0 \neq 0$? How about $\beta_1$?
]

### `glance`ing at a model summary

We can also get model-level summaries by using the `glance` function on our
model object:

```{r}
glance(mod1)
```

- $R^2$ (`r.squared` tells us the percentage of variability in the response variable that 
explained by our predictors

- Here, we see that approximately 60% of the variability in dew point can be 
explained by its linear relationship with barometric pressure.

.question[
What does "explained variability" mean here?
]

---

### What about categorical predictors?

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(DEWP ~ wd, data = beijing)
tidy(mod2)
```

.question[
What do these "slopes" correspond to? Why are there only seven wind directions, 
but eight in total (what happened to wind coming from the east)?
]

---

### What about categorical predictors?

```{r, echo = F}
mod2 <- lm(DEWP ~ wd, data = beijing)
tidy(mod2)
```

- When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, the levels are 
encoded as <font class = "vocab">dummy variables</font>. Dummy variables take 
values of either 0 or 1, depending on whether the condition it corresponds to is 
satisfied.

--

- **Example**: `wdS` takes on the value of 1 if the wind comes from the south, 
and 0 if it does not. 

--

- Each coefficient describes the expected difference in dew point when wind 
comes from that particular direction compared to the baseline level (east).

---

### What about categorical predictors?

```{r, echo = F}
mod2 <- lm(DEWP ~ wd, data = beijing)
tidy(mod2)
```

\begin{align*}
\widehat{DEWP} &= 5.93 - 8.17N - 3.84NE - 12.55NW + \\
&\mathrel{\phantom{=}} 1.95S + 0.31SE -2.10SW - 5.41W
\end{align*}
where the predictors correspond to dummy variables for if the wind is blowing 
from that direction.

.question[
Is there sufficient evidence to suggest differences in dew point depending on 
wind direction? What patterns do you see?
